# PEDSnet Data Request

**Please treat content as confidential**
```{r include=FALSE}
require(tibble)
require(knitr)
source('../code/config.R')
source('../code/req_info.R')
```

## Request Information

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
kable(tribble( ~Item, ~Value,
               'Title', config('title'),
               'Requester', config('requester_name'),
               'Sponsoring Member', config('requester_site'),
               'CDM Version', as.character(config('cdm_version')),
               'Package Version', as.character(config('req_version'))))
```

## Request Summary

This package provides the code to fulfil a PEDSnet data request.

### Request Description

Provide a summary of the scientific specification here.

### Inclusion Criteria

The criteria for inclusion of data in the request are described here.

#### Cohort Definition

If the request involves creation of one or more cohorts, you may wish
to summarize their characteristics here

### Output

The data to be returned in response to the request are described
here.

Please include information on the elements of the data that relate to
regulatory status: aggregate or person-level data, presence of dates
or ZIP codes that constitute elements of a HIPPA limited dataset.  If
the level of data returned to the DCC differs from what will be
returned to the requester, please note this.

### Prerequisites

This query operates on data structured according to the CDM type and
version described above.  Table names and column names must be in
lower case; if your current database uses uppercase, you may use the
`local/lowercase_views.sql` script to create views with appropriate
case.  When configured as distributed, the package requires read
access to CDM fact and vocabulary tables, and the ability to create
temporary tables.  If you choose to define a results schema and retain
intermediates, write access to that schema is required as well.

In this query, *you will need write access `results_schema` as well as
the `cohort_schema` (these could be the same schema) and read access
to the `cdm_schema`.*

In order to access the data, it must be executed in an R environment
with the following packages and minimum versions:

Package | Minimum version
------- | ---------------
R |  3.4.0
DBI |  0.7
dplyr | 0.7.4
dbplyr | 1.2.1
readr | 1.1.1
rlang | 0.2.0
stringr | 1.2.0
tibble | 1.4.2
purrr | 0.2.4
magrittr | 1.5
tidyr | 0.7.2
lubridate | 1.7.4

In general, installing the current version of the `tidyverse` package
will install the remaining non-DBI packages. In addition to these, you
need a DBI-compliant database connector (e.g. `ROracle`,
`RpostgreSQL`) able to connect to your database.  You may also find
the `Argos` package (available on GitHub as `baileych/ohdsi-argos`) a
useful adjunct for storing database connection info outside the code,
but this is optional.

Finally, the code requires write access to the `local` and `results`
subdirectories within the query package tree.

### Execution Process

After uncompressing the request package, please

 1. Edit the file `site/run.R`, following the instructions in the
    file, to reflect site-specific configuration for this request. This
    includes the top level directory of this package. It also includes
    information for settings on retaining intermediates and setting
    results and cohort schemas.
2. If you haven't pointed to a version elsewhere, edit the file
   `site/site_info.R`, following the instructions in the file, to
   reflect metadata about your site, and to describe your database
   structure. The information in this file describes a specific
   version of the CDM, and the content can be reused across all data
   requests targeted to that version of the CDM.
 3. Execute the query package using either
  * `Rscript run.R` from the shell prompt, or
  * Starting an R session, opening the file called `run.R`, setting
    your base_dir to the directory where your package is located and
    then executing `source('run.R')` in the console, or
  * Starting an R session, setting the working directory to the `site`
    subdirectory of the package, and executing `source('run.R')` in
    that session.
 4. When execution completes, return the contents of the `results`
    directory to the DCC.  You can use secure file transfer, or if you
    use email you can encrypt the data to GPG/PGP public key EB9721F7
    (available via pgp.mit.edu; fingerprint A059 C3FF FF1C 8A13 FB9C
    3676 1BAE E514 EB97 21F7).  You should retain the contents of the
    `local` directory for reference.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
<pedsnetdcc@email.chop.edu>.

Thanks!
